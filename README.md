* Or build yourself with [ufbt](README.md#building)

![build status badge](https://github.com/rdefeo/quac/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

This app allows you to organize previously recorded signals, of any type*, so that you can quickly and easily play them back. No more needing to recall whether that door is Sub-GHz or RFID! Just navigate to that action in **Quac!** and press OK to send!

The app does not provide any recording functionality - you must use the existing Flipperzero apps to create the saved files for your action/device. Quac! provides some basic functionality to manage your files. Or, you can manage the folder structure manually on your SD card.

> Supported files include: Sub-Ghz (.sub), RFID (.rfid), Infrared (.ir), NFC (.nfc), and iButton (.ibtn)

## Features

## Navigation / Controls

* Pressing `OK` on a folder label will open/navigate to that folder and display it's contents
* Pressing `OK` on a signal will transmit that signal / playlist
* Pressing `Back` will take you up one folder
* Pressing `Up` and `Down` will, you know, select things up and down...
* Long pressing `Right` will open that item's settings: Rename, Delete, Import Here, Create Group

## Signal playback

The signal files are played back as recorded. During playback/transmit, the LED light will flash blue until the action is complete. For RFID, NFC, and iButton signals, they are continuously played back for their defined durations: RFID - 2.5 seconds, NFC - 1 second, iButton - 1 second. These defaults can be changed in [application Settings](README.md#application-settings).

## Signal Organization

The key to organizing your Quac! interface is to organize your `/ext/apps_data/quac` folder structure. The UI is derived directly from the filesystem structure. Every individual file/signal is given a label on screen. And every folder/directory is a logical group of more files/folders. Selecting a group in the UI will show you the contents of that folder. There is no limit on the number of actions or folders - nest as deep as you want!

You can organize your files by device type, or by function. For example, you may have a folder of "TV" actions, which correspond to Channel Up, Channel Down, Volume Up, Volume Down, etc. Or you may have a "Work" folder, which contains files/actions that correspond to Parking Gate, Garage Door, Lobby Entrance.

The files in a folder can be of mixed types. **This is Quac!'s main strength!** So continuing with the "Work Access" example, the Parking Gate can be Sub-Ghz and the Garage Door can be RFID.

Here's an example file layout for the screenshots above:

```text
/ext/apps_data/quac
  /00_Work
    00_ParkingGate.sub
    01_Garage_door.rfid
    02_Office.rfid
  01_Front_Door.rfid
  /02_Jam_Lists
     00_Gate_Spam.qpl
     01_TVs_OFF.qpl
     02_my_Playlist.qpl
```

## Action Settings

Long pressing the `Right` button will launch a settings menu for the currently selected action. This provides the following options:

* **Rename**: Allows you to rename the selected item. Useful for changing sorting order. The file extension is preserved on signal files. **Note: folder renaming is broken right now**
* **Delete**: Deletes files and folders - folders must be empty
* **Import Here**: Launches file browser to let you select a signal file from anywhere on the SDcard and then copies it to the current folder.
  * When importing an IR file, you are prompted to select which IR command to import. This individual command is imported as it's own `.ir` file into the current location. You can also select `* IMPORT ALL *` to, well, import all commands.
  * If an Import fails, the Flipperzero will flash red and buzz - this may be caused by a duplicate filename (i.e. that file/IR command already exists in the current folder) or the target file can not be read.
* **Import Link Here**: Similar to Link Here, but instead of copying the file, it will generate a Quac Link file (`.ql`) which contains the path of the selected file.
  * At this time, you can not create a link to an IR file, as this would need to also include a reference to the specific signal within the target file.
  * You can not create a link to a Quac Link file.
* **Create Group**: Prompts for the name of a new folder that will be created at that point in the folder structure.

## Playlists

You can chain multiple signal playback actions together by creating a playlist. Simply create a text file, with extension `.qpl`, which contains a list of paths to the signals you wish to transmit - they will be played sequentially. Playlist names show up as clickable action, like all other individual signals/actions. Playlist files feature the following:

* Comments: lines that start with a `#` are ignored
* `pause <ms>` on a line will pause the playback by the specified millisecond duration
* Signal file names can be absolute (full path) or relative to the current directory
* RFID and NFC files can have an optional duration specified. Simply add a space after the signal's file name, followed by a millisecond duration. This duration will override the Quac! Settings value, just for this one signal.

Errors found in the playlist will halt playback and vibrate the Flipper. Blank lines are ignored.

Here's an example playlist called `/ext/apps_data/quac/arrive_home.qpl`:

```text
# Home arrival playlist

.exterior_light_on.sub
.side_door_unlock.sub

pause 2500

/ext/apps_data/quac/03_Stereo/00_On.sub
/ext/apps_data/quac/06_Lights/Disco_Ball.sub

Lava_Lamp.rfid 4000
Neon_Strobe.nfc
```

The first two `.sub` files live in the `/ext/apps_data/quac` folder, which is where `arrive_home.qpl` is located, and they will not show up in any UI screen since they are hidden (they start with a `.`). Next, we pause the playlist for 2.5 sec. The next two files live elsewhere, but can still be referenced by the playlist since they are specified via absolute path. For the last two signals: the RFID signal is transmitted for 4000ms, instead of the duration listed in Quac! Settings, followed by an NFC signal which is transmitted for the default duration.

## Sorting and Naming

The list view UI is based on the sorted file and folder order. This is enforced by sorting the actual filenames. When there are cases where you need to create a specific order, you can prepend the file and folder names with `XX_` where `X` is a digit between 0-9. This will let you place an action called `On` before `Off`, even though when sorted alphabeticaly, `Off` would come before `On`. Therefore, you would name your files `00_On.rfid` and `01_Off.rfid`. But that looks ugly! When the files and folders are rendered for display, any `XX_` prefix will be stripped. All underscores will be replaced with spaces. Extensions will be stripped. Casing is preserved. Additionally, all files and folders that begin with a `.` will be ignored when drawing the UI - these are "hidden" files. However, they can still be referenced in playlists. This keeps the UI uncluttered.

## Application Settings

![Settings menu](screenshots/screenshot_2.png)

The settings menu will appear as the last item when you are viewing the "root" directory. Within the settings you can control:

* Layout: Switch between Horizontal and Vertical layout
* Show Icons: Toggles display of all icons
* Show Headers: Toggles display of header/folder text at the top, giving you room for one more item on screen!
* RFID Duration: Changes the length of time a RFID signal is transmitted. Within playlists, this can be overridden per `.rfid` file.
* NFC Duration: Changes the length of time a NFC signal is transmitted. Within playlists, this can be overridden per `.nfc` file.
* iButton Duration: Changes the length of time a iButton signal is transmitted. Within playlists, this can be overridden per `.ibtn` file.
* SubGhz Ext Ant: Whether to try using the external antenna for sub-ghz signals. If this is "Enabled" but no external antenna is attached, or the external antenna can't be accessed, Quac! will fall back to using the internal antenna.
* IR Ext Ant: Whether to use the external device for IR signals. If enabled, but no external IR device is attached to TX, then the internal IR device will be used.
* Show Hidden: Will display files and folders that start with a period (`.`)
* About: Application info and version

## Troubleshooting

For some errors, Quac! will show an error message on screen. In other cases, it may simply flash the LED red and vibrate. To get more information on what may be happening, it is helpful to connect your Flipperzero to your computer and view the logs. Quac! will print useful information and error information to the log file as it performs its actions. The handy `ufbt cli` command, followed by `log` will show all log statements in real time, and can be very useful if you need to report an error. Check out the [ufbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt) page for more information.
